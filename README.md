# Merry Christmas — A Small Interactive and Romantic Gift

This is a small interactive web project I made as a Christmas gift for a girl.  
It is designed to feel playful, warm, and personal, while staying simple and lightweight.

The experience walks through a few screens, reveals messages one by one, and ends with a heartfelt question and response.

## Design Philosophy

This project was intentionally kept simple:
- No heavy UI
- No distractions
- Just a smooth, emotional flow

Every interaction is meant to feel:
- Gentle
- Playful
- Sincere

## Notes

- All text is intentionally written in **Mandarin Chinese** because it is the native language of the girl I made this for.
- Animations are subtle and non-intrusive
- Navigation includes a back button for comfort and control

## 🌟 Final Thought

This isn’t meant to be a “big” app.  
It’s meant to be a **small, sentimental gift**.

Sometimes that’s more meaningful.
